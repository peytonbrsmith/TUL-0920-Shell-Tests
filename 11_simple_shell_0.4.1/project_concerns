exit

#Concerns when handling the exit commnad:
#
# - Q: Will this function be required to free anything that had been malloc'd yet
# not freed yet? If so, how will this be handled.
#
# - A1: I believed they'd want us to do this as exit is not an abort command and is meant to safely and cleanly exit the program.
#    Thus, I coded mine to free everything when exit is used, then actually exit. - Peyton
